# hello-world
HELLO HUMANS - RS here, I have opened this GitHub account because I am taking CS50. At the same time, I am also working on the automated plant watering project. Some things that I like are: RPi, C++, Python and Scratch. Currently, I am learning alot about CAD software, and computer science. I also like robots, and web apps, and would like to continue learning more.
